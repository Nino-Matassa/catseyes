 Calculating the daily R0
 
 Change UITerraData & UIData daily R0 to show average up to that day.
 
 Sort the sql ascending and count the days for each iteration deviding the sum by nDays for each day.
 Finally sort the table data by date so it shows correctly.
 
 NB: for a day to count it must have > 0 cases otherwise the calculation is thrown.
